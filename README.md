# Inspector MCP Server

AI-powered debugging and monitoring integration for PHP applications through the Model Context Protocol.

## Overview

The Inspector MCP Server bridges the gap between AI coding assistants and production application monitoring,
enabling developers to leverage AI for faster debugging and improved application reliability. Built specifically
for the PHP ecosystem, this server integrates seamlessly with Inspector.dev to provide AI agents with real-time
access to production error data and intelligent analysis.

## Install

```
composer require inspector-apm/mcp-server --dev
```

## Client Configuration

The configuration below is for the MCP client like coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini Code Assist, ), or agentic IDEs like Jetbrains, Windsurf, Cursor, etc.

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "inspector": {
            "command": "php",
            "args": ["[absolute-path-to-your-vendor-folder]/inspector-apm/mcp-server/server.php"],
            "env": {
                "INSPECTOR_API_KEY": "xxxx",
                "INSPECTOR_APP_ID": "xxxx"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can get your application MCP configuration from App Settings in your [Inspector dashboard](https://app.inspector.dev).
