# Inspector MCP Server

Inspector MCP Server was built specifically for the PHP ecosystem; this server provides tools to allow
AI coding agents to access production errors data with comprehensive context, to automatically fix issues,
and to provide actionable recommendations for root cause analysis and resolution strategies.

## Install

You can install the MCP server as a dev-dependency in your project:

```
composer require inspector-apm/mcp-server --dev
```

## Client Configuration

The configuration below is for the MCP client like coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini Code Assist, etc), or agentic IDEs like Jetbrains, Windsurf, Cursor, etc.

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "inspector": {
            "command": "php",
            "args": ["absolute-path-to-your-app-vendor-folder/inspector-apm/mcp-server/server.php"],
            "env": {
                "INSPECTOR_API_KEY": "xxxx", // Inspector API key (https://app.inspector.dev/account/api)
                "INSPECTOR_APP_ID": "xxxx" // The App ID on the Inspector dashboard
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can get the MCP configuration for your application by navigating to the *Application Settings* section in the [Inspector dashboard](https://app.inspector.dev).
